Document Processing Pipeline (LLM/MCP Concept)
This project is a prototype of a multi-stage document processing pipeline, conceptualized to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) via a Model Context Protocol (MCP). It demonstrates a basic flow from document upload and simulated OCR to LLM-powered document type recognition, validation, and a decision on persistence.

Note: This implementation uses mocked LLM responses and simulated OCR as per the original problem statement's allowance for conceptual exploration. Actual LLM API calls and real OCR integration are beyond the scope of this prototype.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to showcase a conceptual document processing pipeline featuring:

Document Upload: A simple web interface for users to select files.

Simulated OCR: A client-side function that simulates the Optical Character Recognition process, returning placeholder text.

Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration: A conceptual server-side implementation of MCP that acts as an intermediary, routing requests to various "LLM tools."

LLM-Powered Tools (Mocked):

Document Type Recognition: An LLM tool to classify the uploaded document (e.g., invoice, contract).

Validation: An LLM tool to validate extracted metadata based on the document type.

Persistence Decision: An LLM tool to decide whether the document should be stored based on validation results.

Persistence & Status Management: While actual storage is not implemented, the pipeline includes a decision point for persistence.

Key Technologies
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for the server-side application.

Express.js: Web framework for handling HTTP requests and serving static files.

TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript for type-safe development.

Webpack: Module bundler for compiling and packaging client-side TypeScript.

HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Standard web technologies for the frontend.

Model Context Protocol (MCP): A conceptual protocol for interacting with LLM-powered tools.

LLMs (Mocked): Simulated responses for document classification, validation, and decision-making.

Setup Instructions
To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd document-processing-pipeline

(Replace <your-repository-url> with the actual URL if this were a real repository.)

Install Dependencies:
Navigate to the project root directory and install all necessary Node.js packages:

npm install

This command will install express, body-parser, typescript, webpack, ts-loader, and nodemon (for development).

Running the Application
Development Mode
For active development, use the dev script. This sets up watchers for both client and server-side TypeScript files, automatically recompiles them on changes, and restarts the Node.js server.

Start Development Server:

npm run dev

You will see output from Webpack, TypeScript compiler, and Nodemon.

Access the Application:
Open your web browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:3000

The client-side console (in your browser's developer tools) will show client-related logs, while your terminal will display server-side (MCP) logs.

Production Build & Run
For a production-ready build or to simply run the compiled application once, use the build and start scripts.

Build the Project:
This step compiles all TypeScript code (client and server) and bundles the client-side JavaScript into public/bundle.js.

npm run build

Start the Server:
This command runs the compiled Node.js server from the dist/server directory.

npm start

Access the Application:
Open your web browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:3000

How It Works (Conceptual Flow)
Document Upload: The user selects a file (e.g., PDF, image) via the HTML input on the web page.

Simulated OCR: The client-side simulateOCR function (in src/client/client.ts) is called with the selected file. This function simulates an OCR process by returning a predefined text string after a short delay.

Client-to-MCP Communication: The extracted (simulated) documentText is then sent from the client to the Node.js server's /mcp endpoint using the McpClient. This client acts as the "pipeline service" making requests to the "LLM tools."

MCP Server Processing:

The src/server/server.ts acts as the MCP server. It receives the request and identifies the tool_name (e.g., recognize_document_type, validate_document, decide_persistence).

Based on the tool_name, it calls the corresponding mock LLM function (e.g., mockLLMClassify, mockLLMValidate). These functions simulate LLM behavior by returning predefined or simple logic-based responses.

Response Back to Client: The MCP server sends the "LLM tool's" result back to the client.

Client-Side Display: The client-side JavaScript updates the web page's output area with the results of each step (recognized document type, validation status, persistence decision).

Persistence Decision: If the document is deemed valid and should be stored, a message indicates this. Actual storage logic (e.g., saving to a database) is not implemented in this prototype.

Important Notes & Limitations
Mocked LLMs: The LLM interactions are entirely simulated. In a real application, these would involve API calls to actual LLM services (e.g., Gemini, OpenAI, etc.).

Simulated OCR: The OCR process is a simple placeholder. A real solution would integrate with an OCR library or service.

No Actual Persistence: The "persistence" step only involves a decision; no data is actually saved to a database or file system.

Conceptual MCP: The Model Context Protocol implementation is basic and conceptual, designed to illustrate the interaction pattern rather than a full-fledged robust protocol.

Client-Side OCR Simulation: For a robust application, file uploads would typically send the raw file to the server, where OCR would be performed (either directly or via another service) before the text is passed to LLMs. Performing OCR directly in the browser can be resource-intensive and limited.

Citations in Code: If you copied code from previous responses, please ensure that any [cite_start] or [cite: x] markers that might have erroneously appeared inside the code blocks are removed. These are not valid syntax and were an error in generation.
